    * Wash ridge gourd well. Peel only the outer green skin (not the hard ridges).
    * Chop the peel into small pieces.

2. **Roast the Ingredients**

    * Heat 1 tsp coconut oil in a pan.
    * Add urad dal, red chilies, and fry until dal turns golden brown.
    * Add hing, tamarind, and the chopped peels.
    * Sauté for 5–6 minutes until peels soften and edges slightly brown.

3. **Grind**

    * Cool the mixture slightly.
    * Add grated coconut, salt, and grind to a coarse paste (add a spoon of water if needed).
    * Adjust salt and spice to taste.

4. **Temper (Optional, for serving as chutney)**

    * Heat 1 tsp oil, splutter mustard seeds and curry leaves, pour over chutney if you prefer a lighter chutney
      consistency.
    * If you’re serving as *thogayal* (thick condiment), skip tempering.
