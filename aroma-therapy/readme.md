# Make you own diffuser using baking soda
Got it 👍 You want to make a **baking soda–based essential oil diffuser** (super inexpensive DIY). These are great for small rooms, closets, or bathrooms. Baking soda absorbs odors, and the essential oils slowly release fragrance into the air.

Here are a couple of easy ways:

## 🟢 Mason Jar Baking Soda Diffuser

**What you need:**

* Small mason jar (or any glass jar with a lid)
* 1/2 cup baking soda
* 15–20 drops essential oil (lavender, sandalwood, lemon, eucalyptus, etc.)
* Piece of breathable fabric (cheesecloth/cotton) or paper + rubber band (if you don’t want to poke lid)

**Steps:**

1. Fill the jar with baking soda.
2. Add essential oils, stir with a spoon or shake.
3. Cover the jar with breathable fabric (or use the lid and poke 5–10 small holes).
4. Place anywhere you want freshening.
5. Shake gently every few days to reactivate the scent.

👉 Lasts 2–4 weeks, depending on room size and oil strength.

✨ **Tips:**

* Use **citrus oils (orange, lemon, grapefruit)** for kitchens and bathrooms.
* Use **lavender or sandalwood** for bedrooms (calming).
* Use **eucalyptus or peppermint** in study/work areas (focus & fresh).
* When the scent fades, just add more drops of oil—no need to replace all the baking soda right away.
