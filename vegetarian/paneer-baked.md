## ðŸ§‚ Instructions

1. **Prepare the marinade**  
   Mix all marinade ingredients in a bowl until smooth. Taste and adjust salt/spice.

2. **Add paneer and veggies**  
   Add paneer cubes (and optional vegetables). Gently toss to coat evenly.  
   Let it **marinate for at least 15â€“30 minutes** (or up to 2 hours in the fridge).

3. **Preheat toaster oven**  
   Set to **425 Â°F (220 Â°C)** and preheat for about 5 minutes.

4. **Prepare the tray**  
   Line the toaster oven tray with **foil or parchment paper** and lightly oil it.

5. **Arrange and bake**  
   Spread paneer pieces in a single layer without crowding.  
   Bake for **10â€“12 minutes**, then **flip** or stir once midway.  
   Bake another **5â€“8 minutes** until edges turn **golden brown**.

6. **Optional finishing**
    - For a **charred, tandoori look**, switch to **Broil** mode for 1â€“2 minutes.
    - Brush with melted butter or oil right before serving.

## ðŸŒ¿ Tips

- If you skip marination, **brush paneer with oil and sprinkle spices directly**, but it will be less juicy.
- Donâ€™t overbake â€” paneer dries out quickly.
- You can also **skewer** the marinated paneer and veggies before baking.
- For extra flavor, sprinkle **chaat masala** or **lime juice** before serving.
