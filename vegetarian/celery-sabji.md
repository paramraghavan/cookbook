### **Instructions**

1. **Prepare Ingredients**:
    - Wash and chop celery. Finely chop onion and green chilies. Lightly roast the besan in a dry pan over low heat for
      2-3 minutes until it turns aromatic (optional but enhances flavor).

2. **Heat Oil**:
    - Heat oil in a pan over medium heat. Add cumin seeds and let them splutter.

3. **Sauté Aromatics**:
    - Add chopped onion and green chilies. Sauté until the onion becomes golden.

4. **Cook Celery**:
    - Add chopped celery, turmeric powder, red chili powder, coriander powder, and salt. Mix well, cover, and cook for
      5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally.

5. **Add Besan**:
    - Sprinkle roasted besan evenly over the celery. Mix thoroughly so the besan coats the celery and absorbs the
      moisture.

6. **Cook the Besan**:
    - Stir frequently and cook for 3-4 minutes on low heat to ensure the besan doesn’t taste raw. If the sabji becomes
      too dry, sprinkle a few teaspoons of water to help the besan stick.

7. **Add Final Spices**:
    - Once the besan is cooked and slightly crispy, add garam masala and amchur powder (or lemon juice). Mix well and
      cook for another minute.

8. **Garnish and Serve**:
    - Turn off the heat, garnish with fresh coriander leaves, and serve hot.

### **Tips**

- Roasting the besan beforehand prevents it from clumping and ensures a smoother texture.
- Adjust the quantity of besan based on how much coating you prefer.
- Serve with roti, paratha, or as a flavorful side with dal and rice.
