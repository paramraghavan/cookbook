# 🧀 Soft & Juicy Baked Paneer (No Veggies)

## 🧂 Ingredients

- 200–250 g **paneer**, cut into 1-inch cubes or slices  
- 2 tbsp **thick yogurt** (Greek or hung curd)  
- 1 tsp **oil** or **melted ghee**  
- ½ tsp **red chili powder** (or paprika for mild flavor)  
- ¼ tsp **turmeric powder**  
- ½ tsp **garam masala** or **curry powder**  
- ½ tsp **salt** (adjust to taste)  
- ½ tsp **crushed kasuri methi** (optional, adds restaurant-style aroma)  
- A squeeze of **lemon juice**  (optional, I do not like to use lemon when heating up with lemon juice on it)

## 👩🏽‍🍳 Instructions

1. **Make the marinade**  
   In a bowl, mix yogurt, oil, chili powder, turmeric, garam masala, salt, kasuri methi, and lemon juice.  
   Stir until smooth.

2. **Coat the paneer**  
   Gently toss paneer pieces in the marinade until fully coated.  
   Let sit for **15–30 minutes** (the yogurt keeps it moist).

3. **Preheat the toaster oven**  
   Set to **425 °F (220 °C)** and let it heat for 5 minutes.

4. **Prepare the tray**  
   Line the baking tray with **foil or parchment** and lightly oil it.

5. **Bake the paneer**  
   - Arrange the pieces in a single layer.  
   - Bake for **10–12 minutes**.  
   - Flip once halfway through.  
   - For a light crust, **broil for 1–2 minutes** at the end (optional).

6. **Rest & serve**  
   Let it sit for 2 minutes after baking — this helps the juices redistribute.  
   Brush lightly with ghee or butter before serving for extra softness.

## Note

- Don’t overbake — paneer turns chewy if kept too long.  
- If your toaster oven runs hot, bake at **400 °F (205 °C)** instead.  
- To make it **vegan**, use **firm tofu** and **plant-based yogurt**.  
- You can store leftovers in the fridge and reheat in the toaster oven for 2–3 minutes.
