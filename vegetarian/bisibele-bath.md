# BISIBELE BATH
_Disclaimer: I am unable to give specific cup size, tbsp or tsp size because it’s pretty much “Kann Allavu”!_

- Raw Rice : Toor dal = 2:1 proportion. 
- Pressure cook both Rice and Toor dal together with turmeric powder. 
- Soak small lime sized tamarind and extract the pulp. 
- Cut the following vegetables ( I cut like finger size)
  - Potato, Carrots, Beans. Add frozen peas. I do not use Onion. 
- Heat a small pan in the stove.
  - Add 1 tbsp oil. 
  - Fry the following spices. 
  - Chana dal, Urad dal, Coriander seeds, Jeera, Red chilies, Black pepper, Cinnamon, Cloves, coconut. 
  - Then Grind them into a paste. 
- Place a large container ( heavy bottom) on the stove. 
  - Add oil (generous amount). 1-2 tablespoon 
  - Add mustard seeds and allow them to splutter. 
  - Add all the vegetables and sauté them well. 
  - Add the tamarind pulp and allow to boil so that the raw smell goes away. 
  - Add turmeric. 
  - Add Salt as needed. 
  - Now add the ground paste with spices. 
  - Allow to boil. 
  - >Be careful and stir so that the bottom does not get burnt. 
  - Add more water if it gets too thick. Oil will separate. 
  - Now add the cooked Rice with Toor dal. 
  - Add salt as needed. 
  - Let it simmer for 5 minutes. 
  - Top off with ghee. 
- Enjoy the  hot Bisibelebath with Raitha and Appalam!
