## 👩🏽‍🍳 Step-by-Step

### 1️⃣ Soak & Cook the Rajma

* Soak overnight (8–10 hrs), I add a pinch of baking soda.
* Pressure cook with pinch of baking soda for **3 whistles**. then keep in low for 10 minutes.
    * Off the stove, and letbe there for 2 minutes, by this time you can easily remove the whistle
* Beans should be soft enough to mash easily between fingers.

👉 *Pro tip:* Slightly mash 1–2 spoons of rajma after cooking. This thickens gravy naturally.

### 2️⃣ Make the Masala Base

* Heat oil/butter. Add cumin seeds + bay leaf.
* Add onion → cook until **deep golden brown** (this is key for Punjabi flavor).
* Add ginger-garlic paste → sauté till raw smell goes.
* Add tomato puree + all dry spices (except garam masala).
* Cook on medium until oil separates. Don’t rush this — takes 8–10 minutes.

### 3️⃣ Combine

* Add cooked rajma + some cooking water.
* Simmer covered on low for **20–25 minutes**.
* Mash slightly while simmering for creamy texture.

---

### 4️⃣ Finish Like a Punjabi Kitchen 😌

* I add 7-8 cashews, grind it and add it(optional)
* Add garam masala.
* Add butter + some milk or cream
* Simmer 2–3 more minutes.

Let it rest **at least 30 minutes** before serving. It tastes better after sitting.
