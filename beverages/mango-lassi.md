# Mango lassi
## Ingredients
* 2 ripe mangoes (or 1 cup of mango pulp if using canned)
* 1 cup plain yogurt (Greek yogurt can be used for a thicker consistency)
* 1/2 cup milk (adjust based on desired thickness)
* 2-3 tablespoons sugar (adjust to taste)
* A pinch of cardamom powder (optional)
* Ice cubes (optional)
  * For a Light Chill:
    Use 2-3 ice cubes if you prefer a mildly chilled lassi without significantly diluting the drink.
  * For a Well-Chilled Drink:
    Use 4-6 ice cubes. This will make the lassi colder and slightly thicker without diluting the flavor too much.
* A few saffron strands or a sprinkle of pistachios/almonds for garnish (optional)

## Instructions
* Prepare the Mangoes:
  * Peel and chop the mangoes. If using canned mango pulp, ensure it's unsweetened.
* Blend the Ingredients:
  * In a blender, combine the mango pieces (or pulp), yogurt, milk, and sugar. 
  * Blend until smooth and creamy. If you prefer a thinner consistency, add more milk. 
  * Add a pinch of cardamom powder for an extra layer of flavor if desired.
* Add Ice:
  * For a chilled lassi, add a few ice cubes to the blender and blend again until smooth.
* Serve:
  * Pour the mango lassi into glasses.
  * Garnish with saffron strands or a sprinkle of chopped pistachios/almonds if desired.
