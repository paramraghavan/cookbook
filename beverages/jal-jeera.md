Jal Jeera Receipe

To make 1 gallon of Jal Jeera using MDH Jal Jeera masala and ginger ale, follow these steps:

### Ingredients:

- **MDH Jal Jeera Masala**: About 6-8 tablespoons (adjust to taste)
- **Ginger Ale**: 2 liters (approximately 2.1 quarts)
- **Water**: 2 liters (approximately 2.1 quarts)
- **Fresh Mint Leaves**: 1 cup (finely chopped)
- **Lemon Juice**: 1/2 cup (freshly squeezed)
- **Ice Cubes**: As needed

### Instructions:

1. **Prepare the Base:**
    - In a large container, combine the 2 liters of water with 6-8 tablespoons of MDH Jal Jeera Masala. Stir well until
      the masala is fully dissolved.
    - Add the chopped mint leaves to the mixture. Stir again.
    - Optional - add the lemon juice to the mixture. Stir again.

2. **Mix with Ginger Ale:**
    - Slowly pour the ginger ale into the container with the Jal Jeera base. Stir gently to combine. The ginger ale will
      add a fizzy texture to the drink.

3. **Taste and Adjust:**
    - Taste the mixture. If you prefer a stronger flavor, you can add more Jal Jeera Masala or lemon juice according to
      your preference.

4. **Serve:**
    - Fill glasses with ice cubes and pour the Jal Jeera mixture over the ice.
    - Optionally, garnish with a few mint leaves or a slice of lemon.

5. **Chill and Enjoy:**
    - If not serving immediately, refrigerate the mixture. Serve chilled.

## Choice between ginger ale and 7Up depends on the flavor profile you prefer for your Jal Jeera:

- **Ginger Ale:** This will give your Jal Jeera a slightly spicy and warm undertone because of the ginger, which
  complements the traditional flavors of Jal Jeera. It's a good choice if you like a bit of complexity and a hint of
  spice in your drink.

- **7Up:** This will make the Jal Jeera sweeter and more citrusy, with a milder flavor compared to ginger ale. If you
  prefer a lighter, sweeter, and more lemon-lime profile, 7Up might be a better choice.

In summary, if you want a more traditional and spicy twist, go with ginger ale. If you prefer a sweeter, citrusy flavor,
choose 7Up. Both can make a refreshing Jal Jeera, so it ultimately comes down to your personal taste preference.

This recipe should yield approximately 1 gallon of Jal Jeera, which is a refreshing, tangy, and slightly spicy drink
perfect for warm weather. Enjoy!
