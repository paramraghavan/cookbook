#### Instructions:

1. **Roast Rava**:
   Heat 1 tsp ghee in a pan and roast rava on low flame until it turns aromatic and slightly golden. Set aside.

2. **Cook Pineapple**:
   In the same pan, add a tsp of ghee, and sauté the finely chopped pineapple for 3–4 minutes.

3. **Add Water & Saffron**:
   Add water to the pineapple. Drop in the saffron strands (or food color) and let it boil.

4. **Cook Rava**:
   Gradually add roasted rava while stirring to avoid lumps. Stir continuously until the mixture thickens.

5. **Sweeten**:
   Add sugar and stir. The mixture will loosen again — keep stirring until it thickens and leaves the sides of the pan.

6. **Flavor & Garnish**:
   Add cardamom powder, remaining ghee, and pineapple essence (if using). Fry cashews and raisins in a little ghee and
   mix into the kesari.

7. **Serve Warm**:
   Serve hot or warm as a dessert or special breakfast item.
