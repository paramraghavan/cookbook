## Instructions

1. **Melt the jaggery**

   - In a heavy-bottomed pan, add **1½ cups jaggery** and **¾ cup water**.
   - Mix well and heat on medium flame until the jaggery melts completely.
2. **Boil to hard-ball consistency**

   - Continue boiling the jaggery syrup on **medium flame**.
   - Check the consistency by dropping a little syrup into a bowl of water:
     - It should form a **hard ball** and make a **crystalline snapping sound** when pressed.
     - If it doesn’t, boil for **another minute** and check again.
3. **Add flavours**

   - Once the syrup reaches hard-ball stage, add:
     - **½ tsp cardamom powder**
     - **1 tsp ghee**
   - Mix well.
4. **Mix with pori**

   - Turn the heat to low.
   - Add **4½ cups murmura / puffed rice** to the hot jaggery syrup.
   - Mix gently but quickly so every grain of pori is well coated.
5. **Shape the urundai**

   - Grease your palms with a little **ghee** (or lightly wet them).
   - While the mixture is still hot, take small portions and **press tightly into round balls**.
   - Work quickly, as the mixture will harden as it cools.

## Tips

- If the mixture is **too sticky**, the syrup is undercooked – boil a bit longer next time.
- If it becomes **too hard** to shape, the syrup is overcooked – sprinkle 1–2 tsp water and warm slightly.
- Use **fresh, crispy puffed rice** for best texture.
- Store cooled pori urundai in an **airtight container**; they stay good for several days.
