* **1 cup** jaggery (vellam), powdered
* **¼ cup** water
* **1 tsp** ghee

---

## 🍯 Instructions

### **1. Prep the puffed rice**

* Dry roast the puffed rice on low heat for **2–3 minutes** until crisp.
* Transfer to a large bowl.

---

### **2. Make the jaggery syrup**

1. Add jaggery + water to a pan.
2. Heat until jaggery melts completely.
3. Strain to remove impurities.
4. Return syrup to the pan and boil until it reaches **soft-ball stage**.

## 🟠 Soft-Ball Stage (Most Important)

Your jaggery syrup is ready when:

* **Cold Water Test:**

    * Drop a little syrup into cold water.
    * It should form a **soft but firm ball** that holds shape.

**OR**

* **1-String Test:**

    * When pulled between two fingers, syrup forms **one thin string**.

This ensures the balls bind properly and don’t crumble.

---

### **3. Add flavoring**

Once the syrup is ready, add:

* Ghee
* Cardamom powder
* Dry ginger powder *(optional)*

Mix well.

---

### **4. Combine with puffed rice**

* Pour hot syrup onto the roasted puffed rice.
* Mix quickly so all pori is evenly coated.
* Let it cool for **30–40 seconds** until safe to touch but still warm.

---

### **5. Shape into balls**

1. Grease palms with a little ghee.
2. Scoop and press the warm mixture firmly into **round balls**.
3. Hold each ball for **5–6 seconds** so it sets.

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

**Mixture not binding?**

* Syrup too thin. Heat for 1–2 minutes and mix again.

**Mixture turning hard?**

* Syrup overcooked. Add **1 tsp hot water** and mix quickly.
