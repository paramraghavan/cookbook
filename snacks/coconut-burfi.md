	•	1 cup white sugar
	•	½ cup water

👩‍🍳 Step-by-Step Instructions

1️⃣ Prepare the Coconut
	•	Let the frozen coconut thaw completely.
	•	Lightly squeeze out excess water (it should be moist, not wet).
	•	Set aside.

⸻

2️⃣ Grease the Tray
	•	Grease a tray or small plate with ghee.
	•	Line with parchment paper (optional) and keep ready.
⚡ You’ll need to transfer the hot mixture quickly later.

3️⃣ Make the Sugar Syrup
	1.	In a heavy-bottomed non-stick pan, add:
	•	1 cup sugar
	•	½ cup water
	2.	Heat on medium flame, stirring until sugar dissolves.
	3.	Let it boil steadily (do not stir constantly) until it reaches one-string consistency:
How to check:
	•	🖐️ Finger test: Touch a small drop between thumb and forefinger — pull apart gently; a single thin string should form.
	•	💧 Cold water test: Drop a bit in cold water — it should form a soft, pliable ball.
	•	🌡️ Thermometer: The syrup should reach 220°F–222°F (104°C–106°C).

✅ At this point, lower the heat.

4️⃣ Add the Coconut
	•	Add the thawed grated coconut to the syrup.
	•	Stir continuously to coat evenly.
	•	Add 1 tbsp ghee while stirring on medium-low flame.

⸻

5️⃣ Cook Until Thick
	•	Continue cooking and stirring for 8–12 minutes, until:
	•	The mixture thickens and starts to leave the sides of the pan.
	•	It forms a soft mass that gathers when stirred.
	•	Add cardamom powder (and milk powder, if using).
	•	Stir for another minute and turn off the heat.

6️⃣ Shape the Burfi
	•	Immediately transfer the hot mixture to your greased tray.
	•	Flatten evenly using a greased spatula or spoon.
	•	Sprinkle chopped nuts if desired and press lightly.
	•	Let it cool for 20–30 minutes at room temperature.

⸻

7️⃣ Cut and Serve
	•	Once set and firm, cut into squares or diamonds.
	•	Store in an airtight container:
	•	Room temperature: up to 3–4 days
	•	Refrigerator: up to 1 week

🧠 Tips for Perfect Texture
	•	⏱️ Don’t overcook the syrup — beyond one-string, the burfi may become grainy or hard.
	•	🔥 Stir constantly after adding coconut to avoid sticking or burning.
	•	🥛 For a softer burfi, add 2 tbsp milk after the syrup stage.
	•	🥥 For a vegan version, replace ghee with coconut oil.
