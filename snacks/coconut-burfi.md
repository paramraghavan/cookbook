## 🧾 Ingredients

- 2 cups frozen grated coconut (unsweetened, thawed completely)  
- 1 cup white sugar  
- ½ cup water  
- 2 tbsp ghee (clarified butter)  
- ½ tsp cardamom powder  
- 1–2 tbsp milk powder (optional, for richer taste)  
- Chopped nuts for garnish (optional)

---

## 👩‍🍳 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1️⃣ Prepare the Coconut
- Let the frozen coconut thaw completely.  
- Lightly squeeze out excess water (it should be moist, not wet).  
- Set aside.

---

### 2️⃣ Grease the Tray
- Grease a tray or small plate with ghee.  
- Line with parchment paper (optional) and keep ready.  
⚡ *You’ll need to transfer the hot mixture quickly later.*

---

### 3️⃣ Make the Sugar Syrup
1. In a heavy-bottomed non-stick pan, add:  
   - 1 cup sugar  
   - ½ cup water  
2. Heat on medium flame, stirring until sugar dissolves.  
3. Let it boil steadily (do not stir constantly) until it reaches one-string consistency.

#### How to Check:
- 🖐️ **Finger test:** Touch a small drop between thumb and forefinger — pull apart gently; a single thin string should form.  
- 💧 **Cold water test:** Drop a bit in cold water — it should form a soft, pliable ball.  
- 🌡️ **Thermometer:** The syrup should reach 220°F–222°F (104°C–106°C).

✅ *At this point, lower the heat.*

---

### 4️⃣ Add the Coconut
- Add the thawed grated coconut to the syrup.  
- Stir continuously to coat evenly.  
- Add 1 tbsp ghee while stirring on medium-low flame.

---

### 5️⃣ Cook Until Thick
- Continue cooking and stirring for 8–12 minutes, until:  
  - The mixture thickens and starts to leave the sides of the pan.  
  - It forms a soft mass that gathers when stirred.  
- Add cardamom powder (and milk powder, if using).  
- Stir for another minute and turn off the heat.

---

### 6️⃣ Shape the Burfi
- Immediately transfer the hot mixture to your greased tray.  
- Flatten evenly using a greased spatula or spoon.  
- Sprinkle chopped nuts if desired and press lightly.  
- Let it cool for 20–30 minutes at room temperature.

---

### 7️⃣ Cut and Serve
- Once set and firm, cut into squares or diamonds.  
- Store in an airtight container:  
  - **Room temperature:** up to 3–4 days  
  - **Refrigerator:** up to 1 week

## 🧠 Tips for Perfect Texture
- ⏱️ Don’t overcook the syrup — beyond one-string, the burfi may become grainy or hard.  
- 🔥 Stir constantly after adding coconut to avoid sticking or burning.  
- 🥛 For a softer burfi, add 2 tbsp milk after the syrup stage.  
- 🥥 For a vegan version, replace ghee with coconut oil.
