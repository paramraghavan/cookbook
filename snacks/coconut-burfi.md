	•	1 cup white sugar
	•	½ cup water

👩‍🍳 Step-by-Step Instructions

1️⃣ Prepare the Coconut
	•	Take the frozen coconut out and let it thaw completely.
	•	Lightly squeeze to remove excess water (you don’t want it soggy).
	•	Set aside.

⸻

2️⃣ Grease the Tray
	•	Grease a small plate, tray, or pan with ghee.
	•	Line with parchment paper (optional) and keep it ready — once the burfi mixture is ready, you’ll have to transfer it quickly.

3️⃣ Make the Sugar Syrup
	1.	In a heavy-bottomed non-stick pan, add:
	•	1 cup sugar
	•	½ cup water
	2.	Stir on medium heat until sugar dissolves completely.
	3.	Then stop stirring and let it boil steadily until it reaches one-string consistency:
	•	Manual test:
Take a tiny drop between thumb and forefinger — when you gently pull apart, it should form one thin string that doesn’t break immediately.
	•	Cold water test:
Drop a bit into cold water — it should form a soft, pliable ball that holds shape but isn’t brittle.
	•	Candy thermometer test:
The syrup should be around 220°F–222°F (104°C–106°C).

✅ At this point, turn the heat to low.

4️⃣ Add Coconut
	•	Add the thawed grated coconut immediately to the syrup.
	•	Stir well so the coconut absorbs the syrup evenly.
	•	Add 1 tbsp ghee now and mix continuously on medium-low flame.

5️⃣ Cook Until Thick
	•	Keep stirring — the mixture will start thickening.
	•	After about 8–12 minutes, you’ll see:
	•	It begins to leave the sides of the pan.
	•	It forms a mass that comes together when stirred.
	•	Add the cardamom powder (and optional milk powder).
	•	Stir another minute and turn off the heat.

⸻

6️⃣ Shape the Burfi
	•	Quickly transfer the hot mixture to your greased tray.
	•	Flatten evenly using the back of a greased spoon or spatula.
	•	Sprinkle chopped nuts if desired and press lightly.
	•	Let it cool for 20–30 minutes at room temperature.

⸻

7️⃣ Cut and Serve
	•	Once cooled and firm, cut into squares or diamonds using a sharp knife.
	•	Store in an airtight container:
	•	Room temperature: 3–4 days
	•	Refrigerator: up to 1 week

🧠 Tips for Perfect Texture
	•	Don’t overcook the syrup — beyond one-string, it may turn grainy or hard.
	•	Stir constantly after adding coconut — it prevents burning.
	•	For a softer burfi, add 2 tbsp milk after the syrup stage.
	•	For a vegan version, replace ghee with coconut oil.

Would you like me to include a variation using condensed milk (faster version that skips sugar syrup entirely but tastes creamy and rich)?
