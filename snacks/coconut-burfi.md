- 2 cups frozen grated coconut (unsweetened, thawed completely)  
- 1.125 to 1.25 cup white sugar

- ½ tsp cardamom powder

---

## 👩‍🍳 Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1️⃣ Prepare the Coconut
- Let the frozen coconut thaw completely.  
- Lightly squeeze out excess water (it should be moist, not wet).  
- Set aside.

---

### 2️⃣ Grease the Tray
- Grease a tray or small plate with ghee.  
- Line with parchment paper (optional) and keep ready.  
⚡ *You’ll need to transfer the hot mixture quickly later.*

---

### 3️⃣ Make the Sugar Syrup
1. In a heavy-bottomed non-stick pan, add:  
   - 1.125 cup sugar  
   - ½ cup water  
2. Heat on medium flame, stirring until sugar dissolves.  
3. Let it boil steadily (do not stir constantly) until it reaches one-string consistency.

#### How to Check:
- 🖐️ **Finger test:** Touch a small drop between thumb and forefinger — pull apart gently; a single thin string should form.  
- 💧 **Cold water test:** Drop a bit in cold water — it should form a soft, pliable ball.  
- 🌡️ **Thermometer:** [candy_thermometer_test.md](candy_thermometer_test.md)

✅ *At this point, lower the heat.*

### 4️⃣ Add the Coconut
- Add the thawed grated coconut to the syrup.  
- Stir continuously to coat evenly.  
- Add 1 tbsp ghee while stirring on medium-low flame.

---

### 5️⃣ Cook Until Thick
- Continue cooking and stirring for 8–12 minutes, until:  
  - The mixture thickens and starts to leave the sides of the pan.  
  - It forms a soft mass that gathers when stirred.  
- Add cardamom powder (and milk powder, if using).  
- Stir for another minute and turn off the heat.

---

### 6️⃣ Shape the Burfi
- Immediately transfer the hot mixture to your greased tray.  
- Flatten evenly using a greased spatula or spoon.  
- Sprinkle chopped nuts if desired and press lightly.  
- Let it cool for 20–30 minutes at room temperature.


### 7️⃣ Cut and Serve
- Once set and firm, cut into squares or diamonds.
