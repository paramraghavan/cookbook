Best banana nut bread recipe without egg , use flaxseeds as egg substitute

Here's a fantastic banana nut bread recipe using flaxseeds as an egg substitute:

### Ingredients:

- 3 ripe bananas, mashed
- 1/3 cup melted butter (or coconut oil for a vegan option)
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 1/4 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 cup sugar (or maple syrup or honey for natural sweetness)
- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tablespoon ground flaxseeds
- 3 tablespoons water (for the flaxseed "egg")
- 1/2 cup chopped walnuts (or pecans)

### Instructions:

1. **Preheat Oven**: Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 4x8-inch loaf pan.

2. **Prepare Flaxseed "Egg"**: In a small bowl, mix 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseeds with 3 tablespoons of water. Let it
   sit for about 5–10 minutes until it thickens into a gel-like consistency.

3. **Mash Bananas**: In a large mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas until smooth.

4. **Add Wet Ingredients**: Stir in the melted butter and vanilla extract, followed by the flaxseed "egg."

5. **Mix Dry Ingredients**: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt. Slowly add the dry
   ingredients to the banana mixture, stirring until just combined.

6. **Sweeten**: Add the sugar or sweetener of your choice, adjusting to your desired sweetness level.

7. **Add Nuts**: Fold in the chopped walnuts (or pecans).

8. **Pour and Bake**: Pour the batter into your greased loaf pan. Bake for 50–60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted
   into the center comes out clean.

9. **Cool**: Let the banana nut bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring it to a wire rack to cool
   completely.

This egg-free banana nut bread has a wonderful nutty texture and flavor, thanks to the walnuts and the flaxseed!

### Tips for Substituting Wheat Flour:

1. **Use 100% Whole Wheat**: You can replace all-purpose flour with an equal amount of whole wheat flour (1:1
   substitution). However, the bread may turn out denser.

2. **Use a Blend**: If you're concerned about density, you can use a 50/50 mix of whole wheat and all-purpose flour to
   maintain some lightness while incorporating the benefits of whole wheat.

3. **Adjust Liquid**: Whole wheat flour absorbs more liquid, so you may need to add a bit more liquid (like a few
   tablespoons of water or milk) to keep the bread from drying out.

4. **Sift the Flour**: Sifting the whole wheat flour before adding it to the batter can help make the texture lighter.

5. **Allow Time to Rest**: Letting the batter rest for 10–15 minutes before baking can help the flour hydrate fully,
   making the bread less dense.

Using whole wheat flour will make the bread a bit heartier, but it will still be delicious and more nutritious!
