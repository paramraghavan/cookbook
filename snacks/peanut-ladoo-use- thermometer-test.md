## 🧾 Ingredients

- 2 cups **unsalted roasted peanuts**
- 200 grams **jaggery (gur)** — preferably dark and unrefined
- ¼ cup **water**
- ½ teaspoon **cardamom powder** *(optional)*
- ½ teaspoon **dry ginger powder** *(optional)*
- 1–2 teaspoons **ghee or water** *(for shaping ladoos)*

## 🍯 Jaggery Syrup Preparation (Thermometer Method)

1️⃣ **Prepare the Pan**

- Use a **heavy-bottomed aluminum or cast-iron pan**.
- Avoid black/non-stick or steel pans — they can overheat jaggery unevenly.

2️⃣ **Melt the Jaggery**

- Add **200g jaggery** and **¼ cup water** to the pan.
- Heat on **medium flame**, stirring occasionally until jaggery dissolves completely.

3️⃣ **Boil to Soft-Crack Stage**

- Once dissolved, let the syrup **boil steadily** without constant stirring.
- Attach a **candy or digital thermometer** to the side of the pan (tip submerged in syrup but not touching bottom).
- Continue boiling until the syrup reaches **260°F–265°F (127°C–129°C)** — the **soft-crack stage**.

🧠 *At this stage, the syrup drop will form a firm ball in cold water and crack slightly when pressed — ideal for crisp,
non-sticky ladoos.*

4️⃣ **Add Flavorings**

- Stir in **cardamom powder** and **ginger powder** if using.
- Mix gently.

## 🥜 Combine and Shape the Ladoos

5️⃣ **Add the Peanuts**

- Immediately add **roasted peanuts** to the hot jaggery syrup.
- Mix quickly and thoroughly until all peanuts are evenly coated.

6️⃣ **Cool Slightly**

- Turn off the heat and let the mixture cool for **1–2 minutes** — it should still be warm but safe to handle.

7️⃣ **Shape the Ladoos**

- Grease your palms lightly with **ghee or water**.
- Take small portions and roll into tight round balls while warm.
- If the mixture hardens, reheat slightly for a few seconds to soften.

## 🧠 Tips for Perfect Peanut Ladoos

- 🌡️ **Thermometer target:** 260°F–265°F (soft-crack stage). Below 255°F makes them sticky; above 270°F makes them hard.
- 🔥 **Keep stirring** after adding peanuts to avoid burning.
- 🥜 **Use warm peanuts** (not cold) — this helps binding evenly.
- ⏱️ Work quickly — once syrup cools, it hardens fast.
- 🧴 Store in an airtight container for up to **2 weeks** at room temperature.


## 🍬 Ladoo Shaping Guide

### 🧊 1️⃣ Cool the Mixture Slightly
- After adding peanuts to the jaggery syrup, **turn off the heat**.  
- Allow the mixture to **cool for 1–2 minutes**.  
- It should be warm and pliable, not smoking hot.  
- Stir occasionally to prevent the syrup from hardening at the bottom.

💡 *Test:* Touch a small piece — it should feel hot but safe to handle.

---

### 🧴 2️⃣ Grease Your Palms
- Rub **ghee**, **coconut oil**, or a few drops of **water** on both palms.  
- **Ghee** adds flavor and shine, while **water** helps if you prefer a lighter texture.  
- Avoid excess water — it can make the jaggery seize or crystallize.

---

### 🥄 3️⃣ Scoop and Roll Quickly
- Use a spoon or spatula to scoop small portions (1–2 tablespoons).  
- Place in your palm and **roll into a ball while warm** — don’t press too hard.  
- Roll quickly between your palms for a smooth, round finish.

⚡ **Tip:** If the mixture hardens midway, **reheat for 10–15 seconds on low flame** to soften it again.

---

### 👥 4️⃣ Alternate Method (If Too Hot)
If you find it too hot to handle:
- Use **two spoons** to shape rough mounds first.  
- Once the mounds cool slightly, **roll them into perfect balls** by hand.

### ✅ Quick Summary

| Step | Action | Purpose |
|------|---------|----------|
| Cool 1–2 min | Lowers temperature | Safe to handle |
| Grease palms | Use ghee or water | Prevents sticking |
| Roll quickly | Work while warm | Smooth round shape |
| Reheat briefly | 10–15 sec low flame | Restores softness |
