## Ingredients
* 2 Cups Unsalted roasted peanuts
* 200 Grams jaggery
* ¼ cup water
* ½ teaspoon cardamom powder - optional
* ½ teaspoon ginger powder - optional


## Jaggery Syrup
* 200 Grams jaggery
* ¼ cup water
* ½ teaspoon cardamom powder - optional
* ½ teaspoon ginger powder - optional
* Use a Heavy Bottom Pan, aluminium preferred. Try to avoid Black/NonStick/Hard Anodised/Stainless Steel Pans.
* Pour all the contents into the Pan
* Boil the jaggery syrup in medium flame until the small bubbles surfacing in the syrup turns into large bubbles and when a drop of syrup added to a bowl full of water settles. Turn off the flame, add in 1 – 1 ½ tbsp of water and mix well.
* check the consistency of jaggery, keep a bowl with cold water on the side.
* Once the jaggery syrup gets thicker, drop a little syrup into the bowl and try to make a ball with the droplet.
If the ball maintains the form when you drop it on a plate, that means the jaggery syrup is ready.
* Switch off the heat, add roasted peanuts to the pan, and mix well.
* Let it cool for a minute before making small balls. (wet your with palm while making ladoo(with water or ghee?); this will help to get the round shape and relief from the heat.)
