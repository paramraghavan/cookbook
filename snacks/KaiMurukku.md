# Kai Murruku

## Ingredients:
 - 2 cups rice flour
 - 1/2 cup urad dal (black gram) flour
 - 1 tablespoon sesame seeds
 - 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds
 - 1/2 teaspoon asafoetida (hing)
 - 1 tablespoon butter, softened
 - Salt to taste
 - Water, as needed
 - Oil for deep frying

## Instructions:
1. Prepare the Dough:
 - In a mixing bowl, combine the rice flour, urad dal flour, sesame seeds, cumin seeds, asafoetida, and salt.
 - Add the softened butter and mix well until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs.
 - Gradually add water and knead to form a soft, non-sticky dough. The dough should be pliable but not too soft.
2. Shape the Murukku:
 - Grease a murukku press (chakli maker) and fit it with the star-shaped or single hole disc.
 - Fill the press with a portion of the dough.
 - On a greased plastic sheet or banana leaf, press the dough out into spirals (murukku shapes), moving your hand in a circular motion.
3. Fry the Murukku:
 - Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat.
 - Carefully lift the shaped murukku from the sheet using your fingers or a flat spatula and gently slide it into the hot oil.
 - Fry the murukku on medium heat until golden brown and crisp. Make sure to flip them occasionally to ensure even cooking.
 - Remove the murukku with a slotted spoon and drain the excess oil on paper towels.
4. Cool and Store:
- Let the murukku cool completely before storing them in an airtight container. They can be stored for several weeks and enjoyed as a snack.

## Tips:
- Ensure the dough is not too dry or too wet. A well-kneaded dough will give you perfectly crispy murukku.
- Fry the murukku in small batches to avoid overcrowding the pan.
- You can also experiment by adding spices like red chili powder or ajwain (carom seeds) to the dough for a different flavor.
