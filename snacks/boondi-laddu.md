## Ingredients
* Boondi
  * 1.25 cup(~160gms) fine basin
  * Water – ¾ cup appx. (175 – 180ml)
  * Ghee or Oil - Sunflower, Canola, Vegetable to fry boondis
* Sugar Syrup
  * 1 ¼ cup (260g appx) sugar
  * 1 cup water
  * 3-4 Cloves in full
  * ½ teaspoon cardamom powder(optional)
  
## Steps
* Make boondis first
* Make sugar syrup
* Add boondis to sugar syrup

## Make boondis
* Add the 1.25 cup besan to a mixing bowl. Pour in (approximately 1.25 cups of) water and mix to form a lump free batter.
* Let the batter sit idle for 15-20 mins. After that, add in more water to adjust the consistency for a flowing consistency batter.
* Flowing consistency batter, meaning the batter in not too thick that, otherwise, i will not flow thru the jhara, it has to be free flowing
* Heat up ghee/oil in high flame, once hot take the boondi jhara and keep it about 4 inches above the ghee and pour in some batter to the jhara.
* Once sufficient boondis have dropped to the ghee, **let them cook for a minute or until boondis stop creating bubbles.**
* Take down to a bowl/sieve/kitchen towel lined plate.
* **Don't make the boondi's too crispy**, if you do so the sugar syrup will have hard time penerating the boondis
* **Batter Consistency** – Test the consistency of batter by pouring some batter in the jhara and see how boondi forms. It
  should fall down drop by drop, if it flows fast, you’d get oddly shaped boondi/lumps of boondi, if it flows slowly
  you’d get hard/tailed boondi.
* **Ghee/Oil Level in Pan** – If the ghee is less in pan, then you’d get flat boondi or many times it turns into a mass/lump in the center.
* **Ghee Temperature** – If the temperature is low, then boondis can stick to bottom of the pan/can be oddly shaped and can
  form into a lump in the center. When the ghee temperature and batter consistency is correct, the boondis fall in the
  ghee then cooks from out instantly to capture the shape and comes to the sides of the pan to cook inwards.

## Sugar syrup
* Use a Heavy Bottom Pan, aluminium preferred. Try to avoid Black/NonStick/Hard Anodised/Stainless Steel Pans.
* In a pan, add in the sugar and water and heat in medium flame. Once it gets boiling, crush and add the cloves.
* Boil the sugar syrup in medium flame until the small bubbles surfacing in the syrup turns into large bubbles and when
  a drop of syrup added to a bowl full of water settles. Turn off the flame, add in 1 – 1 ½ tbsp of water and mix well.
* Sugar Syrup Consistency & trick behind it – Make sure consistency of syrup is correct, if the syrup is thick, then
  boondis will get sugar coated and dry like candy, if it is too thin, then they will absorb the syrup but it won’t set
  from outside and hence it won’t form into ladoos and will remain sticky.

## Mix Boondis with Sugar Syrup
* Boil the sugar syrup in medium flame until the small bubbles surfacing in the syrup turns into large bubbles and when
  a drop of syrup added to a bowl full of water settles. Turn off the flame, add in 1 – 2 tbsp of water and mix well.
* Add in the boondi mixture and start mixing bottom to top. Continuously mix until the mixture is warm and the mixture
  is starting to get dry.
* Get your hands in, and take a little portion in your finger and shape into ladoo using your other hand. Wet your with palm with Ghee while making/shaping the ladoos.
* Repeat the process with rest of the boondi mixture and form ladoos! You may garnish top with nuts if you want to.
