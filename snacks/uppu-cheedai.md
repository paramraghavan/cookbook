Ingredients
	•	1 cup rice flour (store-bought or homemade, roasted slightly)
	•	2 tbsp urad dal flour (roast urad dal, grind, and sieve)
	•	2 tbsp butter (softened, at room temp)
	•	1 tbsp coconut (grated or small pieces, optional)
	•	1 tsp sesame seeds (white)
	•	1–2 tsp salt (adjust to taste)

	•	Oil (for deep frying)

Steps
	1.	Mix the Flours
	•	In a wide bowl, combine rice flour and urad dal flour.
	•	Add salt, sesame seeds, hing, and coconut (if using).
	2.	Add Butter
	•	Rub the butter into the flour until crumbly.
	•	This step ensures crisp cheedai.
	3.	Make Dough
	•	Sprinkle water little by little and knead into a smooth, stiff dough.
	•	Dough should not be sticky.
	4.	Shape the Balls
	•	Pinch small portions and roll into marble-sized balls.
	•	Keep them uniform for even frying.
	•	Spread on a plate for 10–15 mins to dry slightly (reduces bursting in oil).
	5.	Heat Oil
	•	Heat oil in a deep pan on medium flame.
	•	To test: drop a tiny piece of dough, it should rise up steadily (not too fast).
	6.	Fry the Cheedai
	•	Fry in small batches until golden brown and crisp.
	•	Keep flame medium to low to cook evenly.
	7.	Cool and Store
	•	Drain on paper towels.
	•	Cool completely before storing in an airtight container.
