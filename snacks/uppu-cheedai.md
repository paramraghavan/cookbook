# Making Delicious Uppu Cheedai (Crispy Salty Snack)

## Ingredients
- 1 cup rice flour (store-bought or homemade, lightly roasted)
- 2 tbsp urad dal flour (roast urad dal, grind, and sieve)
- 2 tbsp butter (softened, room temperature)
- 1 tbsp grated coconut (optional)
- 1 tsp sesame seeds (white)
- 1–2 tsp salt (adjust to taste)
- ½ tsp asafoetida (hing)
- Water (as needed)
- Oil (for deep frying)

## Steps

1. **Mix the Flours**  
   Combine rice flour and urad dal flour in a wide bowl.  
   Add salt, sesame seeds, hing, and coconut (if using).  

2. **Add Butter**  
   Rub the butter into the flour mixture until it becomes crumbly.  
   This helps make the cheedai crisp.  

3. **Make Dough**  
   Sprinkle water little by little and knead into a smooth, stiff dough.  
   Dough should not be sticky.  

4. **Shape the Balls**  
   Pinch small portions and roll into marble-sized balls.  
   Spread on a plate for 10–15 minutes to dry slightly  
   (reduces chance of bursting in oil).  

5. **Heat Oil**  
   Heat oil in a deep pan on medium flame.  
   Test with a small piece of dough — it should rise up steadily.  

6. **Fry the Cheedai**  
   Fry in small batches until golden brown and crisp.  
   Keep flame medium to low to ensure even cooking.  

7. **Cool and Store**  
   Drain on paper towels.  
   Cool completely before storing in an airtight container.
