# Make spongy **rasgolla (rasgulla)** using paneer you already have at home

## What youâ€™ll need (for \~200â€“250 g paneer â†’ 10â€“12 rasgollas)

* Paneer (fresh/soft preferred): **200â€“250 g**
* Sugar: **1 cup (â‰ˆ200 g)**
* Water: **3 cups (â‰ˆ750 ml)**
* Cardamom: **2 pods** (optional)
* Rose water or kewra: **Â½ tsp** (optional)
* **Optional binders (use only if needed):** Â½ tsp fine semolina (sooji) *or* Â½ tsp cornstarch

**Tools:** wide deep pot with lid, slotted spoon, plate for kneading, measuring cups, bowl.
> To knead you can use the dry home grinder, bset is to with hand as you have more control

---

## Step 1 â€” If your paneer is firm/hard (from the fridge)

1. Cut it into chunks and **soak in warm water** (not hot) for **10 minutes**.
2. Drain, **squeeze gently**, and **pat dry** very well.
3. **Grate or crumble** finely.

*(If your paneer is already soft/fresh, just crumble it and skip the soak.)*

---

## Step 2 â€” Make smooth chhena (the dough)

1. Put the crumbled paneer on a plate.
2. **Knead 8â€“10 minutes**: press and smear with your palm until it turns **smooth, moist, and slightly greasy** (no
   visible grains).
3. If it feels **too dry/crumbly**, add **1â€“2 tsp warm milk or whey** and continue kneading.
   If itâ€™s **too wet**, work in **Â½ tsp semolina or cornstarch**â€”no more.
4. Divide into **10â€“12 equal portions**.
5. Roll each into **crack-free, smooth balls** (marble/golf-ball size; they will expand).

> Tip: Cover the rolled balls with a damp cloth so they donâ€™t dry out.

---

## Step 3 â€” Make a **thin** sugar syrup

1. In a **wide** pot, add **1 cup sugar + 3 cups water**.
2. Add crushed **cardamom** if using.
3. Bring to a **rolling boil**. Skim any foam.
4. (Optional but helpful) Add **Â½ tsp lemon juice** to keep syrup light and prevent crystallization.

> You need **plenty** of boiling spaceâ€”rasgollas should float and move freely. If the pot looks crowded, add a bit more
**hot water**.

---

## Step 4 â€” Cook the rasgollas

1. Keep the syrup at a **rolling boil** (medium-high).
2. **Gently drop** the balls in, one by one.
3. **Cover** and cook **5 minutes** on a lively boil.
4. Open, **swirl the pot** (donâ€™t stir with a spoon) so they donâ€™t stick.
   * If syrup thickens, add **Â¼â€“Â½ cup hot water** to keep it **thin**.
5. Cover again and cook another **7â€“10 minutes** (total 12â€“15 min).
    * They should become **1.5â€“2Ã—** their size and feel **spongy**.
   
**Doneness checks (use any one):**
* Press one lightly between fingers â€” it **springs back**.
* Drop one into a bowl of water â€” it **sinks slowly** and feels **springy**, not dense.

## Step 5 â€” Finish & chill

1. Turn off heat; add **a splash of hot water** if syrup seems thick (keep it light).
2. Stir in **rose water/kewra**.
3. Let them **cool in the syrup** to room temp, then **chill 2â€“3 hours**.
4. Serve cold with plenty of syrup. ðŸ˜‹

## Instant Pot / Pressure Cooker (optional)

* **Instant Pot:** SAUTE to boil syrup â†’ add balls â†’ **Pressure Cook (High) 6 min** â†’ **Natural Release 10 min** â†’ open,
  thin syrup if needed, add essence.
* **Stovetop pressure cooker:** 1 whistle on **medium**, then rest **10 min** before opening.

*(Times vary by cooker; the syrup should remain **thin**, and the balls should be spongy.)*

---

## Troubleshooting (quick fixes)

* **Hard/rubbery:** Syrup too **concentrated** or overcooked. Keep syrup **thin**; add hot water mid-way; donâ€™t exceed
  15â€“16 min.
* **Cracking/breaking:** Chhena was **too dry** or **under-kneaded**. Next time add **1â€“2 tsp warm milk/whey** or a *
  *tiny** binder; knead until smooth.
* **Flat/dense:** Boil wasnâ€™t steady **or** chhena over-kneaded. Maintain a rolling boil; knead just until smooth, not
  oily/greasy.
* **Shrinking after cooking:** Normal; they puff while boiling and settle slightly as they cool.

---

## Scale it fast

* **Per 100 g paneer:** \~**5 rasgollas**, **Â½ cup sugar**, **1Â½ cups water**.
