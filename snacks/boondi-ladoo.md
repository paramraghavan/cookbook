## Making of boondis
Method :

1. Add the besan to a mixing bowl. Pour in about 1.25 cup of water and mix to form
   a lump free batter, the consistency should not be very thick, it should able to flow thru the jhara.
2. Let the batter sit idle for 15-20 mins. After that, add in more water to adjust the consistency for a flowing
   consistency batter. (refer video for exact consistency)
3. Heat up ghee in high flame, once hot take the boondi jhara and keep it about 4 inches above the ghee and pour in some
   batter to the jhara.
4. Once sufficient boondis have dropped to the ghee, let them cook for a minute or until boondis stop creating bubbles.
   Don't make it crispy as it does not help boondis absorb the sugar syrup well.Take down to a bowl/sieve/kitchen towel lined plate.
