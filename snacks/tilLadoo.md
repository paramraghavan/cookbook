#### **Instructions:**

1. **Roast sesame seeds:**
    * Heat a pan on medium flame.
    * Dry roast the sesame seeds until they turn light golden and start to pop.
    * Transfer to a plate and let them cool.
   > To avoid bitter taste - do not grind sesame seeds and  lightly roast until you get the sesame aroma. 

2. **Prepare jaggery syrup:**
    * In the same pan, add 1 tsp ghee (optional) and jaggery.
    * Heat on low flame until the jaggery melts and starts bubbling.
    * Drop a little syrup into cold water: if it hardens and breaks with a snap, it's ready.

3. **Mix and shape:**

    * Quickly mix the roasted sesame seeds into the jaggery
      syrup.
    * Add cardamom powder if using.
    * While the mixture is still warm (but not too hot), grease your hands with ghee and shape into small balls.
