# Nariyal Burfi (Coconut Barfi)

## Ingredients

* **4 cups grated coconut** (fresh or thawed frozen)
* **¾ cup milk**
* **3 cups sugar** 
 > **Note:** I used 3 cups, next time will use 2.5 cups organic sugar or raw cane sugar
* **3 tbsp ghee** (clarified butter)
* **6 green cardamom pods**, powdered (or ½ tsp cardamom powder)
* Extra ghee for greasing the tray


## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Prepare the coconut**  
   Grate the white flesh of fresh coconut (remove brown skin for a snow-white look). Measure 4 cups.
   > I did not do this, but you can grind the thawed coconut in blender, this way it is little more well blended, but 
   > do not grind it that it becomes like a smooth paste  

2. **Fry the coconut in ghee**  
   Heat a heavy-bottomed pan or kadai over medium heat. Add **3 tbsp ghee**. Once melted, stir in the grated coconut.  
   Sauté for about a minute to coat evenly; do **not** brown.

3. **Cook with milk**  
   Add **¾ cup milk** and cook, stirring constantly, until the milk is absorbed and the mixture thickens (about 3–5
   minutes).

4. **Add sugar**  
   Stir in **3 cups sugar**. The sugar will melt and form syrup — keep stirring continuously to prevent burning.

5. **Cook until mixture leaves the pan**  
   Continue cooking on medium-low heat, scraping sides and bottom, until the mixture thickens and starts leaving the
   sides of the pan, forming a soft lump.

6. **Add cardamom**  
   Sprinkle in the powdered cardamom from **6 pods**, mix well, and cook another minute.

7. **Set the burfi**  
   Grease a tray or plate with ghee. Pour the hot mixture in and spread evenly with a greased spatula.

8. **Cool and cut**  
   Let cool 20–30 minutes at room temperature until firm. Cut into squares or diamonds.

9. **Serve and store**  
   Enjoy immediately or store in an airtight container. Keeps 3–4 days at room temperature or up to a week in the
   fridge.

## Tips

* **Stir constantly:** Prevents sticking and ensures even texture.
* **Check readiness:** The mixture should leave the pan sides cleanly before removing from heat.
* **Ghee quantity:**  3 tbsp ghee for better texture and binding.
