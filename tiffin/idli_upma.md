### ðŸ”ª **Instructions**:

1. **Crumble the Idlis**:
   Use your fingers to break the idlis into small, coarse pieces. Donâ€™t mash them.

2. **Prepare the Tempering**:
   In a pan, heat oil or ghee. Add mustard seeds. Once they splutter, add urad dal and chana dal (if using). Let them
   turn golden.

3. **SautÃ© the Aromatics**:
   Add red chili, curry leaves, hing, and chopped onions. SautÃ© until the onions are soft and lightly
   golden.

4. **Add Crumbled Idlis**:
   Add the crumbled idli, idli podi and salt as needed. Mix well so the tempering coats the idli evenly.

5. **Cook for a Few Minutes**:
   Stir-fry on medium heat for 2â€“3 minutes, until heated through.

6. **Finish and Serve**:
   Garnish with coriander leaves. Optionally squeeze in some lemon juice for brightness.
